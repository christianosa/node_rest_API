## What is this?
This example / project was created as an initiative to share something I learned about how to create REST API in NODE (backend).

## Introduction 
This project is an application / sample created to memorize topics from a great online course I attended. It was an interesting sample that I would like to share.
Many projects today need to deliver the REST API to integrate systems. I believe it is a good example to show how to do this.
